# Complexity Theory Tasks
These are **my potentially wrong** solutions to the tasks for complexity theory at HTWG Konstanz in WS20/21.
It is a configured IntelliJ project that contains the proposed library https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/stdlib
and https://bintray.com/algs4/maven/algs4 (both GNUGPLv3)
and makes use of it. After cloning the repo just "open" it with IntelliJ and you will be good to go.
