# Complexity Theory Tasks
These are **my potentially wrong** solutions to the tasks for complexity theory at HTWG Konstanz in WS20/21.
It is a configured IntelliJ project that contains the proposed library https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/stdlib (GNUGPLv3)
and makes use of it. After cloning the repo just "open" it with IntelliJ and you will be good to go.

If you have any issues with the setup or content feel free to contact me.
